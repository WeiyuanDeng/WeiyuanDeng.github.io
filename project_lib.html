                        <p class="mb-3">We are surrounded by all types of materials. However, these materials, rather
                            than being pure homogeneous substances, most of them are heterogeneous materials possessing
                            phases of different materials or the same materials but different phases of states.
                            Heterogeneous materials are non-uniform and can be discerned. Lithium-ion battery is a
                            perfect example for heterogeneous material. The overall properties of the material are not
                            just controlled by its chemical composition, but by numerous details of its hierarchical
                            internal structures spanning from the nano-scale to the macro-scale. Insufficiency of
                            chemical composition for evaluation of physical properties of interests is due to existence
                            of randomness in all materials at some scale-level. Hence multi-scale design of optimized
                            material is the concern of many recent researches.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>In the study, we used Finite Element Analysis to find power density of
                                designed LIB, analyzed the data and find the heterogeneous grain structure of LIB and

                            be regarded as a
                            probability space
                            that can be
                            characterized with statistical approaches. Many descriptors have been proposed for
                            quantification of heterogeneous microstructure. One of the basic tool for characterization
                            of a heterogeneous micro-structure is the n-point correlation functions. And in the case of
                            our study, we are using the two-point-correlation function, which is also the most widely
                            used on among all the n-point-correlation functions. The two-point correlation function is
                            function about the probability of two existing interested points within particular distance.

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Optimization:</strong> The reconstruction of the material is based on
                            the image properties and two-point correlation function. For the basic image property, the
                            ratio of each phase, the number of ‘grains’ and the size of the ‘grain’ need to be find out.
                            The reconstruction process combine a random core selection process and a random grain filled
                            process. In the process of core selection, the core are randomly distributed in the whole
                            image with two criterion: the critical criterion and the grain potential energy criterion.
                            The critical criterion is that there exists an minimum distance between two different cores,
                            while the grain potential energy criterion is that based on the grain potential function,
                            the new grain core are more likely to developed near the existing grain. The process of
                            grain grow simulates the real process of a growing grain by using the random function. With
                            typically probability of grows, for each generation, each pixel’s generation follows the
                            same probability.</p>

                            still works. Compared to the 3D rough view, the 2D sectional view is better in showing the

                        <p class="mb-3">Zhu’s recent numerical simulation efforts have been focused on investigating the
                            variation of local physical and electrochemical properties in a realistic 3D microstructure
                            of a LIB cathode electrode during galvanostatic discharge processes[12, 13]. A cathode
                            electrode (LiCoO2) of a commercial LIB has been scanned using a synchrotron nano-CT at the
                            Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). A raw projection data
                            corresponding to a 58 nm pixel dimension is shown In Fig. 5a. </p>

                        <p class="mb-3">ZThe reconstructed microstructure is shown in Fig. 5b. In this work, a C++ code
                            was developed to rebuild the microstructure of the semi-cell based on the scanned 2D images
                            and resolvethe 3D coupled governing equations using finite volume method, as shown in Fig.
                            6. The galvanostatic discharge process of a semi-cell was simulated and discharge curves at
                            different discharge rates are shown in Fig. 7. In order to compare with the P2D model, the
                            discharge performance was simulated based on the P2D model and the corresponding averaged
                            transport properties. As shown in Fig. 7, the P2D model shows better performance than the 3D
                            model at the 5 C and 10 C discharge rates because the structure inhomogeneity, which is
                            taken into account with the 3D model, will cause more performance drop at large discharge
                            rates[1, 14]. Moreover, the 3D model can also provide valuable insight into the spatial
                            distribution of a variety of variable fields in the cell. Fig. 8 shows the distributions of
                            Li ion concentration in cathode particles and electrolytes and the intercalation reaction
                            rate with the 5 C discharge rate at 600 sec. </p>
