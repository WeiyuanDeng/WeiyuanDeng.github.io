                        <p class="mb-3">We are surrounded by all types of materials. However, these materials, rather
                            than being pure homogeneous substances, most of them are heterogeneous materials possessing
                            phases of different materials or the same materials but different phases of states.
                            Heterogeneous materials are non-uniform and can be discerned. Lithium-ion battery is a
                            perfect example for heterogeneous material. The overall properties of the material are not
                            just controlled by its chemical composition, but by numerous details of its hierarchical
                            internal structures spanning from the nano-scale to the macro-scale. Insufficiency of
                            chemical composition for evaluation of physical properties of interests is due to existence
                            of randomness in all materials at some scale-level. Hence multi-scale design of optimized
                            material is the concern of many recent researches.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>In the study, we used Finite Element Analysis to find power density
                                of

                        </h2>
                        <p class="mb-0"><strong>Characterization:</strong> A random two-phase microstructure medium can
                            be regarded as a
                            probability space
                            that can be
                            characterized with statistical approaches. Many descriptors have been proposed for
                            quantification of heterogeneous microstructure. One of the basic tool for characterization
                            of a heterogeneous micro-structure is the n-point correlation functions. And in the case of
                            our study, we are using the two-point-correlation function, which is also the most widely
                            used on among all the n-point-correlation functions. The two-point correlation function is
                            function about the probability of two existing interested points within particular distance.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">In order to make further analysis more approachable, it is important to transfer
                            the image into binary.We crop the image to get rid of the outer boundaries which are useless
                            for the study and characterization. In this example, we chose the image with more regular
                            boundaries which could be more easily reconstructed. When the image is ready for
                            characterization, the 2 point correlation functions could be applied.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Reconstruction:</strong> The reconstruction of the material is based on
                            the image properties and two-point correlation function. For the basic image property, the
                            ratio of each phase, the number of ‘grains’ and the size of the ‘grain’ need to be find out.
                            The reconstruction process combine a random core selection process and a random grain filled
                            process. In the process of core selection, the core are randomly distributed in the whole
                            image with two criterion: the critical criterion and the grain potential energy criterion.
                            The critical criterion is that there exists an minimum distance between two different cores,
                            while the grain potential energy criterion is that based on the grain potential function,
                            the new grain core are more likely to developed near the existing grain. The process of
                            grain grow simulates the real process of a growing grain by using the random function. With
                            typically probability of grows, for each generation, each pixel’s generation follows the
                            same probability.</p>
